 Exploring Multiple Processes and IPC
=====================================
 The project will simulate a simple computer system consisting of a CPU and Memory. 
 The CPU and Memory will be simulated by separate processes that communicate.

*NOTE: Make sure you "cd" into the src directory.*

Compile
---------------
```
javac *.java
```

Arguments
---------------
```
java ProcessesIPC [program_path] [-debug]
```

Example
---------------
```
cd src
javac *.java
java ProcessesIPC ../program3.txt
```

Program Descriptions
